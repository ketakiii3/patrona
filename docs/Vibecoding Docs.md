**The 6 Documents**  
**You Need Before**  
**Writing Any Code**

A complete guide \+ ready-to-use templates for founders, indie hackers, and vibe coders.

# **Why these documents matter**

AI coding agents are powerful — but they're not mind readers. The more context you give them upfront, the better and faster they build.

These 6 documents eliminate ambiguity. Instead of the AI guessing what stack to use, how screens connect, or where data lives — it knows. The result: fewer hallucinations, less back-and-forth, cleaner code.

Think of these as the briefing you'd give a senior developer on Day 1\. The more complete the brief, the better the output.

| \# | Document | One-line purpose |
| :---: | :---- | :---- |
| **01** | **PRD — Product Requirements Doc** | What you're building and for whom |
| **02** | **TRD — Technical Requirements Doc** | Which tech, tools, and APIs you'll use |
| **03** | **App Flow** | Every page, every click, every navigation path |
| **04** | **UI/UX Design Brief** | How your app looks and feels |
| **05** | **Backend Schema** | Data structure, tables, auth, relationships |
| **06** | **Implementation Plan** | The exact step-by-step build sequence |

**01**  
**PRD**  — Product Requirements Document

*The north star. Everything else flows from this.*

**Why it matters**

The PRD is the first document you write — before any code, design, or architecture. It defines what you're building, who it's for, and what success looks like.

Without a PRD, your AI agent fills in the blanks with assumptions. Some will be right. Most won't be. A solid PRD means fewer surprises.

**What to include**

* App name and tagline

* The problem you're solving and for who

* Core value proposition (what makes your app different)

* Target user persona — describe them in 2–3 sentences

* List of all features (split into Must Have / Nice to Have)

* User stories — 'As a \[user\], I want to \[do X\] so that \[Y\]'

* Out of scope — explicitly list what this version does NOT do

* Success metrics — how you'll know the product is working

**Template**

| Document 01 — PRD Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **App Name** | e.g. TaskFlow |
| **Tagline** | One sentence. What does it do? |
| **Problem** | What pain does this solve? Who feels it? |
| **Target User** | Describe your primary user in 2–3 sentences |
| **Core Features (Must Have)** | List each feature on a new line |
| **Nice to Have** | Features for v2 / if time allows |
| **Out of Scope** | What this version explicitly won't do |
| **User Stories** | As a \[user\], I want to \[action\] so that \[outcome\] |
| **Success Metrics** | e.g. 100 signups in first week, task completion rate \> 80% |

**02**  
**TRD**  — Technical Requirements Document

*The blueprint your AI agent needs to make technical decisions without guessing.*

**Why it matters**

The TRD translates your product vision into technical decisions. It answers: what language, what framework, what database, what third-party services.

When you skip this, your AI picks a stack on its own — sometimes well, often inconsistently. The TRD locks in the choices so the agent stays coherent across every file it writes.

**What to include**

* Frontend framework (e.g. React, Next.js, Vue)

* Backend framework or runtime (e.g. Node/Express, Python/FastAPI)

* Database type and provider (e.g. PostgreSQL on Supabase)

* Authentication method (e.g. Supabase Auth, Clerk, NextAuth)

* Hosting and deployment (e.g. Vercel, Railway, Fly.io)

* Third-party APIs and services (e.g. Stripe, Resend, OpenAI)

* Folder structure and naming conventions

* Environment variables needed

* Any hard technical constraints or preferences

**Template**

| Document 02 — TRD Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Frontend** | e.g. Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | e.g. Next.js API routes / Supabase Edge Functions |
| **Database** | e.g. PostgreSQL via Supabase |
| **Auth** | e.g. Supabase Auth — email \+ Google OAuth |
| **Hosting** | e.g. Vercel (frontend), Supabase (backend \+ DB) |
| **Third-party APIs** | List each: name, purpose, free/paid tier |
| **Key Libraries** | e.g. React Query, Zod, Lucide Icons |
| **Environment Variables** | List each variable name (not value) |
| **Constraints** | e.g. Must work on mobile, must be free tier only |

**03**  
**App Flow**  — Navigation & User Journey Map

*Every page, every click, every path — mapped before a single screen is built.*

**Why it matters**

The app flow tells your AI exactly how users move through your product. What happens when they click a button. Where they go after signup. What the logged-out vs logged-in experience looks like.

Without this, the AI builds pages in isolation. They work individually but don't connect. The app flow is what makes your product feel like one coherent thing.

**What to include**

* List of all screens / pages with short descriptions

* Navigation structure (sidebar, tabs, back buttons, etc.)

* Entry points — where does the user land first?

* Auth flow — signup → onboarding → dashboard sequence

* Key user journeys (the most important 2–3 flows)

* Edge cases — empty states, error states, loading states

* Modal / drawer / overlay interactions

* Redirect logic — where does each action take the user?

**Template**

| Document 03 — App Flow Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Pages List** | List every page: / (home), /login, /dashboard, /settings, etc. |
| **Navigation Type** | e.g. Top navbar, left sidebar, bottom tabs (mobile) |
| **First Screen** | What does a brand new visitor see? |
| **Auth Flow** | Signup → Email verify → Onboarding → Dashboard |
| **Core User Journey 1** | Step-by-step: User wants to \[goal\]. They go to... then... |
| **Core User Journey 2** | Another key flow |
| **Empty States** | What shows when there's no data yet? |
| **Error States** | e.g. Failed payment, network error — where do users go? |
| **Redirects** | e.g. After login → /dashboard, after logout → / |

**04**  
**UI/UX Design Brief**  — Visual & Interaction Design Guide

*So the AI doesn't just build something functional — it builds something you'd actually use.*

**Why it matters**

AI agents default to plain, unstyled, or inconsistent UIs when left to their own judgment. The design brief locks in your visual language: colors, fonts, component style, spacing, and overall vibe.

You don't need to be a designer. Even a rough direction ('dark mode, minimal, like Linear') gives the AI enough to make coherent decisions across every screen.

**What to include**

* Overall aesthetic direction (e.g. minimal, bold, playful, corporate)

* Color palette — primary, secondary, background, text, accent

* Typography — font choices, heading sizes, body size

* Component style — rounded vs sharp corners, flat vs shadowed

* Dark mode / light mode preference

* Inspiration references (apps you like the look of)

* Key UI patterns (cards, tables, modals, sidebars)

* Mobile responsiveness requirements

* Accessibility considerations (contrast, font size, etc.)

**Template**

| Document 04 — UI/UX Design Brief Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Aesthetic** | e.g. Minimal, clean, dark-mode first. Like Linear or Vercel. |
| **Primary Color** | e.g. \#6C47FF (indigo) |
| **Background Color** | e.g. \#0D0D0D (dark) or \#FFFFFF (light) |
| **Text Color** | e.g. \#F5F5F7 |
| **Accent / CTA Color** | e.g. \#6C47FF |
| **Font** | e.g. Inter for UI, Geist Mono for code |
| **Border Radius** | e.g. 8px rounded corners throughout |
| **Shadows** | e.g. Subtle card shadows, no heavy drop shadows |
| **Dark/Light Mode** | e.g. Dark mode primary, light mode optional |
| **Reference Apps** | e.g. Linear, Vercel, Notion, Raycast |
| **Mobile** | e.g. Fully responsive, bottom tab nav on mobile |

**05**  
**Backend Schema**  — Data Model & Auth Architecture

*How your data is stored, structured, and secured — defined before the AI writes a single migration.*

**Why it matters**

The backend schema is the hardest document to change after the fact. Once your database has data in it, restructuring tables is painful. Getting this right upfront saves hours of debugging and migration hell.

Your AI agent uses this to write database migrations, API routes, and auth logic. The more precise you are, the less it has to guess — and the fewer security holes end up in your codebase.

**What to include**

* List of all database tables with columns and data types

* Primary keys and foreign key relationships

* Indexes (which columns need fast lookup?)

* Auth model — who can access what? (Row Level Security rules)

* User roles and permissions (admin, user, guest, etc.)

* Any sensitive fields that need encryption

* File/media storage structure (if applicable)

* Webhooks or event triggers

* API endpoint list (optional but helpful)

**Template**

| Document 05 — Backend Schema Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Table: users** | id (uuid), email (text), name (text), created\_at (timestamp), role (text) |
| **Table: \[your table\]** | id, \[columns\], user\_id (FK → users.id), created\_at |
| **Table: \[your table\]** | Add more tables as needed |
| **Relationships** | e.g. projects.user\_id → users.id (many-to-one) |
| **Auth Provider** | e.g. Supabase Auth — JWT tokens, email/OAuth |
| **Row Level Security** | e.g. Users can only read/write their own rows |
| **User Roles** | e.g. admin: full access, user: own data only |
| **File Storage** | e.g. Supabase Storage — /avatars/{user\_id}, /uploads/{user\_id} |
| **Sensitive Fields** | e.g. payment\_method — stored via Stripe, not in DB |

**06**  
**Implementation Plan**  — Step-by-Step Build Sequence

*The exact order to build so the AI never skips a foundation layer.*

**Why it matters**

The implementation plan is your build roadmap. It tells the AI agent what to build first, second, and third — and why that order matters. Skipping this leads to the AI building the frontend before the backend exists, or adding auth after the DB schema is half-baked.

Think of it as a checklist the AI ticks off. Clear phases, clear milestones, clear completion criteria. The more specific you are, the less the agent freelances.

**What to include**

* Numbered phases (not just tasks — phases with goals)

* Phase 1 always: Project setup, repo, folder structure, env vars

* Phase 2: Database schema and migrations

* Phase 3: Authentication flow

* Phase 4: Core features (in order of dependency)

* Phase 5: UI polish and responsive design

* Phase 6: Testing, error handling, edge cases

* Phase 7: Deployment and environment configuration

* Explicit 'done' criteria for each phase

**Template**

| Document 06 — Implementation Plan Template |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Phase 1: Setup** | Init project, install deps, configure env vars, set up repo structure |
| **Phase 2: Database** | Write all migrations, set up RLS policies, seed test data |
| **Phase 3: Auth** | Implement signup/login/logout, protected routes, session handling |
| **Phase 4: Core Feature 1** | Describe the feature and its sub-tasks in order |
| **Phase 5: Core Feature 2** | Next most important feature |
| **Phase 6: Core Feature 3** | Continue for all core features |
| **Phase 7: UI Polish** | Responsive design, loading states, empty states, error states |
| **Phase 8: Testing** | Manual test all flows, fix edge cases, handle errors gracefully |
| **Phase 9: Deploy** | Set up prod environment, configure domains, final env vars |
| **Done Criteria** | What does 'finished' look like? e.g. All core flows work end-to-end |

# **How to use these documents**

You don't have to write all 6 from scratch manually. Use Claude or ChatGPT to help you fill them out — just paste the template, answer the prompts conversationally, and let the AI clean it up into a proper document.

**Suggested workflow**

1. Start with the PRD — get your product idea out of your head and into writing

2. Fill in the TRD — decide your stack before anything else

3. Map your App Flow — draw it out, then describe it in text

4. Write the UI/UX brief — even just 'dark mode, minimal, like Notion' helps

5. Design your Backend Schema — tables first, relationships second

6. Write your Implementation Plan — phases, not just a flat task list

Once all 6 are done, paste them at the start of your AI agent conversation. Tell it: 'Here are my project documents. Use these as the source of truth for everything you build.'

*The 10 minutes you spend on these documents saves hours of fixing broken code, re-explaining context, and undoing bad architectural decisions.*
